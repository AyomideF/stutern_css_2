            I love the fact that all I need to do is read the mannual, if it is
            a machine or look it up on <i>Google</i>, which is as result of
            <i>Internet</i> through technology. Technology has also made
            communication very easy for me, as I can send and receive message
            within seconds. I also love it because it gives me access to learn
            with <b>Stutern</b> without physical interactions.

            Learning about the web works has been
            <i>interesting, insightful and tasking.</i> I learnt what makes the
            web works requires <b>HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</b> We were first
            introduced to git and github. The html is a language that serves as
            the building block of the web and uses element tags to make it
            meaningful for the computer to understand. The <b>CSS</b> is known
            as the <i>Cascading Style Sheets</i> and this helps to beautify the
            web. <b>CSS</b> makes the website pleasing to the eye and gives it a
            great user experience.

            <b>Padding</b>: It is used to
            <i> create space around an element's content,</i> inside of any
            defined borders.

          <p>
            <b>Margin</b>: are used to <i>create space around elements</i> ,
            outside of any defined borders.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Border</b>: border properties allow you to specify the
            <i> style, width, and color</i> of an element's border.
